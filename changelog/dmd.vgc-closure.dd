-vgc now reports locations of nested functions that create closures

When a GC-allocated closure was created, the `-vgc` switch would only point to the outer function that a closure was created for.
For a big function, this still requires you to search where the nested function requiring the closure actually is.
It now reports the closure function and variable location just like in error messages for `@nogc`.

```
auto closure()
{
    int x;
    int bar() { return x; }
    return &bar;
}
```

After:

$(CONSOLE
vgc.d(1): vgc: using closure causes GC allocation
)

$(CONSOLE
vgc.d(1): vgc: using closure causes GC allocation
vgc.d(4): vgc: function `bar` closes over variable `x`
vgc.d(3): vgc: `x` declared here
)
